Sanderson-Williams
<br><br>
Irene, eldest daughter of Mr and Mrs T.N. williams of Moonthal, Middle Park, was a slender and gracious figure in her robe of ivory romaine and duchess satin when she stood at the chancel in All Saints' Church of England East St. Kilda, Melbourne, on February 19, at her marriage to James Francis, eldest son of Mr. and Mrs. S.J.E. Sanderson, of Port Augusta (S.A.).
<br><br>
The long train fell in toft rippling folds, while a veil of exquisite honiton lace (lent by Mrs. Reeve of Malvern), was mounted on deep ivory tulle and arranged in a fascinating "snood" caught in frangipanni blossoms. The bride crried a point lace handkerchief that had belonged to her grandmother and her sheaf of flowers looked very lovely against the ivory gown.
<br><br>
The two bridesnaids, the Misses Joyce St. Clair Willimas and Nancy Hare - wore frocks of deep 
current red romaine, with flowers in their hair, and carried armfuls of gladioli. The trainbearer - Jean Watson - was very sweet in her demure silk net frock, little
Juliet cap, and puiff sleeves and she carried a basket of blossoms.
<br><br>
The ceremony was performed by the Rev. Bright Parker and Mr. Willimas gave his daughter away.
Mr. H.C. Sanderson was best man and Mr T.N. williams (jun), groomsman. Relations and a few intimate friends were entertained at dinner after the service, the party being held at Grosvenor Queen's road.
