PERSONAL<br>
Mr. E. J. Foster, who went from Orroroo to South Africa to join the Telegraph Department nine years ago at the time of the war, has returned on six months' furlough. Mr. Foster was accompanied to South Africa by Mr. G.C.O. Sanderson, of Port Augusta. Mr. Sanderson is stationed at Capetown, and is doing well. All the South Australians have turned out excellent officers, and have made good advancement. The prejudice against Australians is rapidly dying out. Mr. Foster says.
<br>Mr Foster, who travelled overland from Sydney to Adelaide, states that the railway departments of South Africa cater for the second class passengers much better than do the Australian railways. South Africa, also leads the way inasmuch as the people enjoy the benefits of penny postage within
the colony and also to England and America. The concession has been greatly appreciated by the public.

The Express and Telegraph (Adelaide, SA)<br>
Nov 16 1899
<br><br>
Messrs. E. J. Poster and G. C. 0. Sanderson, the telegraph operators who were selected to go to South. Africa at the request, of the Postmaster-General of Cape Colony, leave on the express this afternoon for Melbourne, where they will join the S.S. Afric, en route for the Cape. Both the young men are about 22 years of age, smart operators, and will probably be located in Cape Town to replace others who have been sent to the outskirts of the seat of war. They will begin their service in Cape Colony at a considerable increase on the salaries they were receiving here. Mr. Foster was stationed at Orroroo, and Mr. Sanderson at Port Augusta.
