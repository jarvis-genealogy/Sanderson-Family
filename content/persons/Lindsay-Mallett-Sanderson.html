ELECTRIC LIGHT FOR PORT AUGUSTA WEST.
<br><br>
On Monday last His Worship the Mayor of Port Augusta (Mr. K.H. Hunter) and the Corporation's Electrical Engineer (Mr. W. Keer), waited as a deputation on the West-Side Council, to discuss with them the proposition of reticulating Port Augusta West with electricity. The
deputation suggested laying mains over the bridge, and said that the Corporation would offer the West Side subscribers the same conditions as those ruling in Port Augusta, and the services of the Electrical Engineer would also be made available to the West-Side citizens. The proposition was given a favorable hearing, and after discussion, Mr. L.M. Sanderson (Mayor of Port Augusta West) promised to canvass the town for subscribers and go into the mat
ter of street lighting. He will report at a later meeting, when it is hoped that some finality will be reached.

Port Augusta Ferry,
<br>
At a meeting of the Port Augusta West Council on March 18 the Mayor (Mr L. M. Sanderson) referred to the proposed new ferry service to be undertaken by the Government and the proposed expenditure of three or four thousand pounds in connection therewith. He considered the expenditure wouid give more satisfaction if utilised in the direction of providing a bridge. He thought the council would work with the West Coast in agitating for the same. On the motion of Crs D. McSporran and S.J. Kirwan, it was decided that a letter be written to Mr Harvey, member for the district, asking for full particulars as to what the Government purposed doing in connection with the new ferry service.
