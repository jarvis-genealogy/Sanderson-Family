According to Francis McCoy, Annie Sanderson came from Killingworth House near Newcastle-on-Tyne.
<br>
Notice of marriage to Alexander McCoy in SA Register 18/7/1862.

<b>Part copy of a letter from Annie to George recounting Alexander's actions during the 1890 maritime strike.</b>
<br><br>
"... night the Engineers quietly got up steam - There was some stock that could not be put on board until about two in the morning, and the Vessel was only ready about an hour before daybreak.
<br><br>
All this time the Vessel was being watched all night by crowds of angry men, determined not to let any of a Crew on board, but apparently were not prepared for the Vessel actually going away without a Crew, as only Papa could be seen about. The steam being up Papa secretly cut almost through the lines holding the ship, so that on the least movement of the Engines they would break.
<br><br>
The Inspector of Police was awfully frightened at the appearance of affairs, and told Papa the numbers were increasing, and he had only a small Force. So Papa finding the Engines could be moved, instructed the Engineers to go full speed at once without waiting for orders or anyone on the bridge or at the helm. This took the mob unawares. The Vessel moved off - The lines broke as intended, and before they had time to think how they had been duped, she got clear, amid yells, groans, Execrations of the would be obstructives. papa then went on the bridge and commenced to steer her ....., and was joined by the two office boys who helped - Papa would not let them appear before, for fear of being stoned by the mob. After the Vessel got into the Gulf the Captain, who had sailed from Melbourne with sufficient ........ ........ put on board at Glenelg - the passengers also, with 2 Bishops and 4 .... joined the Vessel. And in the afternoon the Vessel sailed. This is the turning point, had the scoundrels succeeded in preventing the vessel from getting away, there is no (?) telling what complications might have arisen.
<br><br>
They want now to give in - and have done so concerning the first differences, but there are many things to be arranged, and Papa thinks a settlement is a long way off yet.
<br><br>
It has been a very anxious time and I fortunately had no idea until all was over that Papa was placed in such a dangerous position - and I feel quite proud of my brave husband who so fearlessly ........ the bridge alone, prepared if need be to defend the vessel with his life - while the other Captains of the company ..... here in the Port were afraid to lend him a helping hand lest the mob stoned them.
<br><br>
Should the Police not be able to manage the mob the Lancers * have to be called out, and then Arthur will have to join them. It makes me quite miserable to think of it. I wish he had never joined the Volunteers. I hope you will not be tired with this long Epistle, but I thought perhaps it might interest you. Papa & I desire ..... ..... ..... kindly ..... ..... Mrs Hensley. and with much love to yourself from both of us and kisses to Alick from me.
<br><br>
Yr Affectionate Mother
<br>
Annie McCoy
<br><br>
Papa sends his best love and a kiss and thanks you very much for your pretty present for his birthday. Papa says you must give ...... a kiss for him.
<br><br>
* The Adelaide Lancers were a military force at the time before Federation. Both great-uncle Arthur and my grandfather Francis were lieutenants in it at one time. I think the date of this letter was 1890 and Francis by then would have been in WA. Arthur died in April 1892.
<br><br>
From Helen Heggie...."Her brother Francis was married to Sarah, daughter of William Younghusband - merchant, landowner, shipping agent, ship owner, Member of the Sth. Australian Legislative Council and Premier of South Australia. [refer to notes for Capt William Davidson]"
