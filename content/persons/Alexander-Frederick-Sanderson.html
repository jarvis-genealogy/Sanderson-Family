Afternoon Wedding at All Saints Church
<br>
SAINT-SANDERSON CEREMONY
<br><br>
All Saints Church, Port Augusta, was beautifully decorated with tulle and cellophane bows, centred with a tiny posy of pink and cream flowers attached to the seats for the guests by Mrs. Stuart Holland, of Quorn, and Mrs. J. Barrett of Queensland, for the wedding on the
afternoon of Saturday, May 5. of Elaine, only daughter of Mr. and Mrs. C.J. Saint, of Fort Augusta, and Leslie, eldest son of Mrs. and the late Mr. A.F. Sanderson of Port Augusta West. The Very Rev. Father J.J. Prendergast officiated.
<br><br>
The bride, who was escorted into the church by her father, was gowned in a beautiful frock of pearl tinted magnolia slipper satin. The low round neckline of the bodice was defined by two rows of plaited satin caught on the left side with a cluster of orange blossom. The long, tight fitting sleeves were pointed over the wrists and the very full skirt gathered at the waistline, fell from two wide inverted pleats at the back to a very long, full train. The magnolia tinted tulle veil, which was edged with wide chantilly lace from her mother's
wedding dress, fell to knee length in handkerchief points, and was held in place by a tiara of frangipanni, deep cream chrysanthemums, and pale pink rosebuds. She carried a large horseshoe shaped bouquet, the frame of which was carried by her mother on her wedding
day. It consisted of deep cream gladioli around the outside edge, shading to pale pink towards the centre, and had trails of matching flowers.
<br><br>
The bride's sister-in-law, Patricia Saint, of Broken Hill, was matron of honour, and Miss Dorothy Sanderson was bridesmaid. They wore classic gowns of rose pink heavily corded faille. The tightfitting bodices were sleeveless with narrow shoulder straps, and shoulder capes edged with ruching, which also defined the front pointed waistlines. The skirts were full circles, ballerina length in front, gradually lengthening from the sides to form long trains at the back. Their skull caps were of silver lame with pink gladioli forming a cluster on the left side, and narrowing to wards the front. Shower bouquets of pink gladioli were carried. They wore long above-the-elbow length pink silk gloves and silver shoes.
<br><br>
Mr. Colin Greenfield was best man and Mr. Eugene Saint, of Broken Hiil, was groomsman. Mrs. Cyril Moran presided at the organ and during the signing of the register, Mr. C. Moran sang "Ava Maria". As the bride left the church, an ornamental horseshoe was hung on her arm by her aunt, Mrs. E. McMahon and little Miss Glennice Greenfield hung a cluster of golden wishbones.
<br><br>
The bride's mother wore a frock of black silk crepe with touches of blue, under a light wool pleated aqua blue coat. Her black shiny straw hat was wreathed across the front with blue flowers and a shoulder spray of cream and blue fiowers was also worn. Mrs. Sanderson, mother of the groom, was present in a selt patterned woollen frock in a soft shade of green, with trimmings of brown. A brown hat and autumn toned shoulder spray were worn. 
<br><br>
A reception was held at the Town Hall Supper Room. The tables were decorated with low bowls of pastel coloured flowers, and large bowls of pink dahlias were dotted around the rocm and in
window boxes. Mr. Cyril Moran announced the guests, who were received by the parents and bridal party.
<br><br>
A beautifully decorated wedding cake took pride of place in front of the bride and bridegroom. It consisted of three storeys of hearts, decorated in a lacey design. Rev. Fr. Prendergast officiated and the usual toasts were honored. A large and beautiful display of wedding preeents was admired by the guests. Mr. Ron Till was pianist during the reception and a musical programme, with Mrs. Moran as accompaniste, was much appreciated. Those contributing were Mrs. V. Sanderson, Mrs. A. Dighton, Mr. J. McKnight, Mr. C. Moran and Mr. C.J. Saint. Later, the bride and bridegroom left on their honeymoon, which is being spent at Victor Harbour. The bride's travelling frock was of dove grey president cloth. The bodice had a U shaped yoke of blue net appliqued in grey, and a deep band surrounding the yoke was
of grey appliqued in blue. A close fit ting blue grossgrain hat with spikey trimmings, and a light weight blue flared coat was also worn. Grey snakeskin shoes and bag, and a shoulder spray of pink carnations completed the outfit. Mr. and Mrs. Sanderson will make their home at Port Augusta.
