Adelaide Observer (SA)<br>

<br><br>

Meeting at Port Augusta.
<br><br>
A meeting was held at Mr. Sanderson's residence, Port Augusta on Monday evening, December 17 to consider the necessity for police protection for that township and other local matters. Mr. Burgoyne presided, and there were about 20 persons present.
<br><br>
Mr. F. C. V. Sanderson moved : 
<br>
"That this meeting, considering the large increase of population which has taken place in Port Augusta West, and the great number of travellers who come occasionally from the bush, deem it absolutely necessary that police protection should be afforded to Port Augusta
West as soon as possible, as already serious and in some cases fatal accidents have occurred, which might have been prevented had there been a policeman in the township"
<br><br>
He said he was in fear of having his store burnt down at night by men who wandered about the place smoking and striking matches, and he had often to get up at night in order to protect his property. Mr. D. McSporran seconded, and the motion was carried unanimously. 
<br><br>
The question of the erection of a Post-Office in the township was then considered by the meeting, and it was resolved that as great inconvenience and delay had often occurred to the inhabitants of Port Augusta West through there being no Post-Office in the place, the Postmaster-General should be requested to establish a Post-Office at once in the township, as it could be done at a very trifling cost in connection with one of the stores in the place.
<br><br>
Various arrangements were then made for sending out memorials to Mr. P.B. Coglin, M.P.; and 
a committee consisting of Messrs. F. C. V. Sanderson, D. McSporran, J. McCarthy, C.W. Ogilve and C. Kite were appointed to carry out the  before-mentioned resolutions. During the debate high encomiums were paid to Mr. Coglin for the way in which he had watched over the interests of the district during the past sessions of Parliament.
