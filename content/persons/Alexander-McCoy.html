Alexander was mate of "Gem" in 1854 on trip from Southhampton to Melbourne. It carried six passengers . It left Sthptn 22 March and arrived Melbourne 20 July.
<br><br>
Was master of SS "Marion" wrecked SA 1862. The steamer "Marion" went ashore near Cape Spencer in foggy conditions on 11 July 1862. By 10.00 am as the tide rose she began to break up. Within a few hours her masts & funnel disappeared, and she broke amidships as the stern settled in deep water. Passengers & crew, numbering about 50 were landed safely and later taken to Port Adelaide by the SS Lubra. The Marion was a vessel of 197 tons, built in 1854. Jack Loney "SA Shipwrecks"
<br><br>
In "The Romantic SA Placenames" says of Marion
<br><br>
Marion Bay
<br><br>
A lands dept source says it was named after the steamer Marion (Capt A McCoy) which was wrecked on a reef near the Althorpes, in 1862. This explanation is contradicted by the Mortlock Library reference - 'The newspaper report of the wreck mentionned Marion Bay as a place already named. However a sailing ship, of the same name, was wrecked south of the Troubridge Shoal, in 1851"

Extracts from "Our Place in the Sun"
<br>
By Alan McLellan
<br><br>
"Now it is proposed to write about one of the earliest of the Captains in Spencer Gulf trade, who had a strong link with Port Augusta, and this is Captain A. McCoy.
<br><br>
The South Australian Parliament in 1857 made a provision for granting a subsidy of 1000 pounds for steamers to Ports Augusta & Lincoln. In that year Mr Joseph Darwent, shipowner & merchant, of Adelaide, purchased a steam vessel called s.s."Marion" by means of which he provided fortnightly communication between Ports Adelaide, Augusta & Lincoln.. At that time Mr A.D. Tassie, representing Messers Elder, Stirling & Co., at Port Augusta, was acting as the postmaster, but when Mr Hiram Mildred arrived in 1858, as Custom Officer, he took up those duties with many others. In the sketch book of B H Babbage, explorer, there is one drawing showing Port Augusta from the West Side, with Babbage's camp in the foreground and the steamer, "Marion" coming up the Gulf. It was drawn in 1858. I was keen to find out more about that little vessel, and with the assistance of Captain J Gillespie of SA Harbours Board pilotage service at Port Adelaide, who was one-time pilot for Port Augusta, and also Harbor Master at Port Pirie, additional information was secured, although some details were not at first available...
<br><br>
....vessel was wrecked 102 years ago. The ship left Port Adelaide July 10, 1862, bound for Wallaroo, with a small general cargo & 85 passengers. At about 4.00 a.m. on Tuesday, July 11, 1862, the "Marion" struck the cliffs about a mile and a half to the east of Cape Spencer, which lies at the South-Western point of Yorke Peninsula. It is near that place where Marion Bay appears on the map. It was calm at the time, and Captain McCoy succeeded in getting all the passengers ashore in boats, but he was unable to save anything beyond a few provisions and the mainsail, those early steamers being also rigged for sail
<br><br>
Copy of Report
<br><br>
Ship-lovers & other readers might find interest in reading a copy of the report, in a letter from Captain McCoy to Mr Darwent. This letter details the happenings. The letter was dated at Adelaide July 13, 1862, and reads,
<br><br>
The following is an account of the loss of the steamer "Marion", of which I have already informed you. On Tuesday the 11th Instant I was on deck. The wind light off the land and the water smooth, vessel steering by standard compass W by S. Saw Cape Yorke distinctly, bright moonlight and clear. Knew we should make Althorpes by 4 a.m. the Mate relieved the watch, the Second Mate pointed out to his the Little Althorpes distant 8 to 9 miles. At about 5 a.m. felt the vessel strike on the rocks, was on deck in an instant, when I saw the cliffs distant about 20 yards. Commenced immediately to provide for the safety of the passengers, and sent lifeboat away with as many as possible, with instructions to land them on first smooth beach. Then I got a good hawser ashore and a communication being established with the shore was able to despatch both boats with passengers and provisions. Cut away the mainsail for shelter as it would evidently be a severe night. Having now time to ascertain some particulars how the vessel could get on the Cape in such a short time - it being a complete mystery to me. The Mate said it came in thick and he was deceived by the appearance of Althorpe Island, and altered her course two points, which, of course, at once account for the casualty. How he came to do such an imprudent thing, or neglect to acquaint me with the thickening of the weather, he does not account for. The ship began to break up rapidly. I went on board and sent signal-gun on shore. The "Lubra" being due from Port Lincoln on Saturday evening made every preparation to attract her notice, which we succeeded in doing and every soul was received on board last evening by eight o'clock and arrived at the Port by daylight this (Sunday) morning. Signed - Alex McCoy. Late Master s.s. "Marion"
<br><br>
Court of Enquiry
<br><br>
Captain J Gillespie has also notified me of having read through a copy of the Marine Court of Enquiry, but could ..............tinued next week.
<br><br>
Old Yarn
<br><br>
There is an old yarn which might well be retold, indicating that Captain McCoy possessed a good sense of humour. At the time when Captain McCoy was master of the old passenger and cargo vessel "Lubra", a man who had the misfortune to be deaf & dumb, was on board "Lubra" at Port Augusta. He conducted conversation by means of writing on a slate, and had approached the Mate of the little vessel, but had incurred that officer's displeasure in some way, and the latter wrote on the slate "Go to hell!" The mute then went to see Captain McCoy and wrote a message for his perusal, which read " Your Mate told me to go to hell". Jocular Captain Alex McCoy, in diplomatic mood, then scribbled a reply - "Well, don't you go"
<br><br>
The old "Lubra' was brought out from England by Captain Gordon in early days of steamships, and was one of the pioneer Gulf Vessels. She carried many passengers to and from Port Augusta for many years. She came to grief, eventually, in Julien Bay, Western Australia, on January 4 1898.
<br><br>
Company Formed
<br><br>
The Adelaide Steamship Company was formed and registered on October 9 1875, with a nominal capital of 100,00 pounds. Mr R Barr Smith was the first Chairman of Directors, and Mr Herbert Evans the first Secretary. Captain Alexander McCoy who was appointed Ship's Husband, was snet to England to supervise the building of two new steamers, the "South Australian" and the "Victorian" for Inter-Colonial passenger trade. The Spencer Gulf Steamship Company had been operating in South Australian waters. In November, 1882, an agreement was entered into by that company for the Adelaide Steamship Company to acwuire the business and plant. By absorbing that fleet, The Adelaide Steamship Company had to finance the undertaking by by increasing its capital from 100,000 pounds to 300,000 pounds, by the issue of 10,000 new shares of 10 pounds each. By this transaction the little steamers "Franklin", "Investigator", "Flinders", "Emu", "Lubra", and "Royal Shepherd" became the property of the Adelaide Steamship Company as from December 16, 1882, and a number of other vessels were purchased or built within the next few years. These included the "Ferret" which had a romantic history which may be related in this column at some later date. That steamer was stolen from Scotland by a clever ruse, eventually being traced in Melbourne.
<br><br>
Captain Alexander McCoy was the first Marine Superintendent for the Adelaide Steamship Co., from 1875 intil his death in 1895
<br><br>
Early Settler
<br><br>
One of the early settlers of Port Augusta West was Mr F C V Sanderson, who married the daughter of Mr J Tortoise, another pioneer of Port Augusta. Mr Sanderson left many worthy citizens as descendents. Recently Mr Warren Back handed me a lengthy cutting from a newspaper, discoloured by age, and having frayed edges. I appears to have been a portion of a copy of "Advertiser" Adelaide, and would have been published in 1895 following upon the death of Captain McCoy. That obituary recalls that Captain McCoy was a brother-in-law of Mr F J Sanderson, the former Collector of Customs, at Port Adelaide, who was a brother to Mr Sanderson (Senior) of Port Augusta West. The late Mrs W Back was a daughter of the latter gentleman, and presumable had preserved this interesting clipping 69 years ago.
<br><br>
Adventurous Life
<br><br>
Before joining The Adelaide Steamship Company Captain Alexander McCoy had an adventurous life. He was born at Portsmouth, England in 1821, his father being a paymaster in the Royal Navy. When he had reached the age of 11 years his father died, and two years later the lad shipped as an apprentice on board a ship bound for Australia, reaching Sydney in time to celebrate his 14th birthday. He left the vessel without the necessary permission being obtained as the youngster found the life hard and rough on that ship. He joined several coasting vessels, and on one voyage was wrecked on the New Zealand coast. He spent considerable time living amoung the Maoris, and learnt their language. After leaving New Zealand he made several voyages across the pacific in the Whaling days "when the arms of the strong alone ruled in the South Seas" .. built for the use on the Euphrates, were brought to Australia for the Murray trade, but were unfit for the purpose intended, and Captain McCoy was engaged to take one of them to Batavia, and the long, risky voyage in the small vessel was safely accomplished.
<br><br>
Captain Mccoy was among those who left seafaring when the Victorian gold diggings broke out, but not being very successful at the goldfields, he returned to the sea. Not long afterwards he became associated with the shipping trade between Port Adelaide and Port Elliott. With Captain Jenkins, he became interested in a small craft called the "Gem", and with other little ships in that trade. On the introduction of a steamship service to Spencer Gulf ports, where schooners and ketches had only been trading, he was given command of the "Marion" and was Master of her in July 1862 when she ran on the rocks near Cape Spencer and afterwards foundered. No lives were lost, the vessel remaining on the bank of steep rock until all on board had reached the shore. That old newspaper reported that "Marion" then "slid back" into the deep water "where the hull is still believed to be lying". For some years he was in command of the steamer "Flinders" when Captain Alexander Hay brought out that larger vessel from England for the Spencer Gulf Steamship Company.
<br><br>
Pioneer
<br><br>
It is noted in another item "Our Shipping Reporter" that Captain McCoy was one of the pioneers of the shipping interest of South Australia, and after serving a time in the troopers (presumably having been in the police troopers after his Victorian gold rush experiences) he noticed the opening for a trader from Port Adelaide to Port Elliott and bought a smart cutter named the "Gem", and was brought in contact with the possibilities of the River Murray, which was little known at the time. After Captain Cadell opened up river traffic in his flat-bottomed steamer, Captain Alex. McCoy sent to Scotland fro two iron craft to be put together there. In due time he superintended the construction of the "Sturt" and the "Leichardt", two steamers which did excellent service in the early days of river navigation. Then he purchased the schooner "Crinoline" for intercolonial work and became part owner of a barquette the "Englebart" for voyages to and from India. He soon saw the opening for steamers in the Spencer Gulf trade, and lived to enjoy many years of distinction in these waters before taking up his position ashore in control of those ships which played such an important part in early development of Port Augusta and district."

<br><br>
I consider the circumstances therein alluded to, to require minute, careful and immediate investigation. Inspector Gordon indeed has been for some time in a state of health which incapacitates him from proceeding on a duty of this description, and Inspector Joliner's (?) presence is absolutely required at Head Quarters. I have therefore respectfully to recommend that the subject may be brought under the notice of Mr Moorehouse, The Protector of Aborigines, and if His Excellency should consider it expedient that the Protector should make the requisite enquiries, I will take care that he is attended by an active and efficient Police Officer to assist him in the performance of this duty, Corporal Mason also being, I regret to say, seriously indisposed.

To His Excellency Sir Richard Graves Macdonnell, Knight Governor in chief of the Colony of South Australia
<br><br>
The Memorial of the undersigned inhabitants of the Townships of Goolwa, Hindmarsh Island, Currency Creek and the Neighbourhood
<br>
Humbly Showeth
<br><br>
That the Aborigines habitually pass over from Hindmarsh Island to the peninsula of Lake Albert by a series of Islands and shallow intervening channells (sic).
<br><br>
That your Memorialists consider it of great public importance, that the practicability of improving this means of communication between Hindmarsh Island and the peninsula of Lake Albert should be ascertained as early as convenient.
<br><br>
That your Memorialists believe that the aforesaid shallow channels are capable of being easily filled up by earthern embankments.
<br><br>
That such embankments with the Islands would form a continuous line of road from the West end of Hindmarsh Island (opposite the Goolwa Township) to the Peninsula of Lake Albert, the South Eastern District of this Colony, generally, and also be the most direct overland route from Adelaide to Melbourne.
<br><br>
That by this means a large tract of good Agricultural Crown Land would be rendered easy of access to the Farmer ans intending Settler, and consequently a large revenue accrue to the Government from the sale and cultivation of land now lying unproductive.
<br><br>
That the suggested embankment would concentrate the Murray Stream into one channel around the West End of Hindmarsh Island, and render the water at the Goolwa generally fresh at Ebb Tides.
<br><br>
That by thus cutting off the water communication between the Lakes and the Coorong, and re-directing the water of the latter to a narrower channel, its navigation would be improved.
<br><br>
That your Memorialists believe that as a consequence of the Waters of the River Murray being confined in one Channel and flowing into the Sea in one Continuous Direction, the Navigation of the Mouth of the said River would be rendered more easy and permanent.
<br><br>
That taking both distance & public convenience into consideration, your Memorialists believe that this route, which promises to be the most direct overland road to Melbourne, would be the most suitable course for the contemplated Electric Telegraph to Melbourne.
<br><br>
That your Memorialists therefore pray Your Excellency to cause a survey of the locality to be made, and such other steps to be taken in the matter as Your Excellency may deem expedient.
<br><br>
And your Memorialists as in duty bound, will ever pray, etc. etc. etc.

Extract from "The Scots in Australia" by Malcolm Prentiss
<br><br>
... Meanwhile, in South Australia, four Scots between them owned more than half of a syndicate. They were Andrew Tennant, Thomas Elder, Robert Barr Smith and Captain Alexander McCoy. Tennant and Barr Smith were boyhood friends from Lochwinnoch, Renfrewshire and Elder was Smith's brother-in-law. This group formed the nucleus of the Adelaide Steamship Company founded in 1875. McCoy was the captain of their first ship; he later went to Glasgow to liaise with Hendersons, the shipbuilders. All the directors except one were Scots and a majority of the directors were Scots until well into the twentieth century.
<br><br>
Extract from South Australian Shipping Lines (State Library of South Australia)
<br><br>
Beginnings.
<br><br>
In 1875 or late 1874 Captain Alexander McCoy conceived the idea for a new steamship company on the Adelaide to Melbourne run. With the agreement of other Adelaide businessmen a proposal was made to float shares for the Adelaide Steamship Company (ASC). The first ship of the new company was the Flinders, 521 ton, with accommodation for 112 passengers, built at Sunderland during 1874 and arriving Adelaide March 1875. Flinders had been built for the Spencer's Gulf Steamship Company but was placed on the ASC's Melbourne run when she arrived from the builders (the businessmen behind Spencer's Gulf SS Company were also involved in the new Adelaide Steamship Company.) The Flinders was subsequently placed into the Spencer Gulf trade for which it had been intended, but in 1882 Spencer's Gulf SS Company amalgamated with ASC which thereby obtained Flinders and Franklin, another new steamer purchased by the latter company.
<br><br>
A rate war ensued with McMeckan Blackwood of Melbourne which was already supplying a regular run to Adelaide: passengers on the run were the only ones to benefit from this. A deal was eventually struck between the two companies, with McMeckan Blackwood continuing to service the intermediate (mainly South East of South Australia) ports. ASC wanted to get into the South East trade, but had to fight off more competition from Melbourne firms, William Howard Smith & Sons, and Nipper & See. After threatening Howard Smith's Melbourne to Sydney run, peace was made with a complex agreement about bunker coal and agents. Nipper & See were more difficult to deal with and ASC directors even considered selling out. Eventually the matter was resolved, with ASC buying the Claude Hamilton and agreeing not to compete against Nipper & See. ASC now turned its attention to the South East trade, and also planned services to Western Australia and New South Wales. By end of 1882 ASC had bought out William Whinham, acquiring three additional steamships, in addition to the already mentioned acquisition of the Spencer's Gulf Steamship Company which included the 605 ton Investigator still being built in the UK. With the acquisition of Spencer Gulf Steamship Company, Adelaide Steamship Company gained six ships for 90,000 pounds. They now had complete domination of the Spencer Gulf, South East and Melbourne steamship trade.
<br><br>
Obit. Employed as an apprentice mate when just 13 years old in the British Merchant Service [Foreign & Colonial] he arrived in Sydney in 1835 where he 'jumped ship'.
<br><br>
His adventurous early life included experience on the New Zealand coast, where he was shipwrecked and spent 2 years there, living amongst the Maoris, and learning their language.
<br><br>
He made several voyages across the Pacific in a whaling vessel.
<br>
He then spent some time serving on various coastal vessels and in 1841 he was employed on the schooner 'Royal Mail' as second mate. From 1848 until 1850 he was a trooper in the South Australian Mounted Police. He had an unsuccessful spell on the Victorian diggings, before he and a partner bought a schooner for coastal trading between South Australia and Victoria.
<br><br>
Alexander purchased the 'Gem', a cutter of 52 tons in 1856 from his brother-in-law Capt. William Davidson. This vessel sailed between Port Adelaide and Port Elliot until 1870 when she was sold to Melbourne owners.
<br><br>
He earned the reputation of being able to work a sailing craft in and out of Port Elliot's difficult harbour better than any other seaman.
<br><br>
Despite such abilities he saw that the future lay with steam, and in December 1856 he was advertised as the master of the steamer 'Leichardt', sailing for Rapid Bay with calls at Onkaparinga, Port Willunga and Yankalilla. This ship and her sister 'Sturt' had been imported to run on the Murray following the opening of the river for trade by Capt Cadell, and their owners put them on the coastal trade during the off season on the river. Alexander eventually took the 'Leichardt' to Batavia for sale to the Dutch.
<br><br>
On his return to Port Adelaide he went into sail again and in 1863 he purchased, in partnership with E. Jenkins, the 'Crinoline', a schooner of 63 tons. This vessel frequently traded to Coffin Bay and also made occasional voyages to Victor Harbour and to Warnambool in Victoria. She was sold to interstate owners in 1872. He was also part owner of the schooner 'Engelbert' which like the 'Crinoline' was used for the coastal trades.
<br><br>
He was invited to join the syndicate which owned the 'Marion' to join their purchase of a new steamer, the 'Lubra'. He subscribed 6/64ths and took over command of the 'Marion' while Ward went to Britain for the new ship, and remained part of the syndicate while it expanded its operations into the purchase of further steamers.
<br><br>
He was issued with a Pilotage Exemption Certificate in 1870 which enabled him to Pilot a Ship within the limits of Port Adelaide, which was extended in 1865 to include the ports of Wallaroo & Port Augusta. He was issued with a Certificate of Competency as Master on 1st December 1870 by the Marine Board of Sth Australia. On 27th April 1875 he was granted pilotage exemption for the Port of Melbourne. He also qualified as Master from the British Board of Trade in 1876.
<br><br>
Eventually he became a foundation shareholder in the Adelaide Steamship Company in 1875, and was appointed Warden of the Marine Board of South Australia on 16th September 1885, a position he held until shortly before his death in 1895. He was married a second time in 1862 to Annie Sanderson. They had 2 children.

He earned the respect and esteem of all he was brought into contact with by the excellence of his work and the genuineness of his character, and his knowledge of the rise and progress of South Australian shipping was unique. In private he was a most esteemed man, of rare principles and acquirements.

The wreath, which was of colossal size and one of the largest ever executed in the establishment, was most artistically designed and made of white camellias, white carnations, white roses, cyclamen, and the choicest ferns. A foul anchor, the chain of which was beautifully worked in violets, was placed in the centre, while imprinted on silk surrounding the wreath were the words "From the Staff of the Adelaide Steamship Company."

DEATH OF CAPTAIN McCOY A PORT ADELAIDE IDENTITY.
<br><br>
Captain McCoy, an old Port Adelaide identity, died at North Adelaide on Monday morning. The deceased was born at Portsmouth in 1821. His father, who was a paymaster in the Royal Navy, died when his son was only eleven years old, and the latter was sent at the age of thirteen on board a vessel as an apprentice at his own request, and spent his fourteenth birthday in Sydney Harbour; but, not liking the treatment he received on board the vessel, he ran away and shipped on board of another craft. He was once wrecked on tho coast of New Zealand, where he lived with the Maoris, whose language he learnt. He was also engaged in whaling in the Pacific, but he eventually went to the diggings in Victoria, where he was only fairly successful. His mate, however, did better, and between them they bought a schooner, with which they did a coasting trade. After that came the purchase of the Gem, and Captain McCoy eventually bought his partner out.
<br><br>
Although with the characteristio reticence of his race the late Captain McCoy rarely said anything about his own affairs and devoted himself almost: entirely to business, he was a popular man and much liked despite his reserve and bluntness. It is related of him that many years ago, whon a couple of river steamers were sent to Australia for the Murray trade, one proved not exactly what was most suited to that erratic stream, and Captain McCoy was sent in it to Batfavia, with a commission to sell it to the Government, who wanted such & craft to assist in putting down some trouble in their possessions in Borneo.
<br><br>
Always ready for any enterprise, he got together a scratch crew, add accomplished the voyage successfully, handing over the boat in due form. Captain McCoy has been identified with the Marine Board one way and another since Captain Douglas's time, and was always looked up to as an authority. 
<br><br>
He was officially associated with the Marine Board from the passing of the Act ot 1881. When in 1875 tho Adelaide bteamihip Company, in which he was in a sense one ot the founders, was started, he was sent to Scotland to superintend tho construction of the Company's steamers - South Australian and Victorian- at D. W. Henderson's shipyard, Glasgow, and brought one of them out. He held the post of Marine Superintendent, and commanded several of the Adelaide steamship Comany's vessels from its inception. He had charge of the Victorian for some time in the trade between South Australia aud Victoria, and won the reputation of being a careful commander, always solicitous for the safetyof his vessel and the comfort of his passengers. 
<br><br>
He was inseparably associated with the old days of sailing ships, and could tell interesting stories of his experiences which would have furnished Clark Russell with material for a romance of the antipodes. A period many years ago he was associated with Captain Ward in the steam ship Lubra, and was one of the promoters of the Spenser's Gulf Steamship Company. Ultimately this Company's operations were extended, and the Adelaide Steamship Company eventuated. The well-known Gem, a cutter, formerly an English yacht, was a craft with which he was associated, and he sold her in 1875. She was employed in the coasting trade, principally in wool and wheat, and it used to ba said that Captain MgCoy could work a craft into and out of Port Elliot better than any one of his contemporaries. It was only on Sunday that Mr. J. Turnbull, an old frieud of the deceased gentleman, saw him at his residence, Molesworth -street, North Adelaide, and found him fairly well, indeed he had no idea that the end was so near.
<br><br>
Captain McCoy attempted to move a heavy letterpress some weeks ago, a rather risky effort at his advanced age, and strained himself. He had been attended by Dr. Vereo, his trusted medical advisor. The deceased nautical celebrity leaves two sons, Mr. G. McCoy, who is in ths Civil service, and Frank McCoy, who is at present in Cue, Western Australia, Mr. F. J. Sanderson is a brother-in-law. At Port Adelaide the news of the death of Captain McCoy, who for so many years had been identified with the shipping interests of that place, was received with profound regret by his many friends. The Flags at the Custom House, the commercial houses, and on all the vessels in harbour were half-masted during the day out of respect to the deceased mariner.
<br><br>
Tbe funeral takes place on Wednesday. Last night, our Shipping Reporter wrote : - Captain Alexander McCoy, who died on Monday, was one of those properly known as a pioneer of the shipping interests, aud for half a century he devoted his best energies in fostering aud improving the shipping and taking advantage of every change for the better which was from time to time devised. It may well be said ho grew with the shipping interest, and was about as strict a type of hardworking colonist as could bo found. In point of fact, he was always ready and eager to improve as the circumnstances and changes cf the colony demanded. After serving a short time in the troopers he noticed an opemug for it trader from Port Adelaide to Port Elliot, and purchased a very smart cutter named the Gem, in command ot winch he established a regular line of traffic, aud he thus recognised the possibilities of the River Murray, which was but little known at that time. After Captain Cadell opened up tbe river traffic in his flat-bottomed steamer, Captain McCoy sent to Scotland for two iron craft to be put together here, and he superintended the construction of the Sturt and Leichhardt, two steamers which did excellent service in the early days of river traffic. 
<br><br>
Then he purchased a fine schooner named the Crinoline for intercolonial work, and became part owner of a barquette named the Englebart, which made successful voyages to and from India, and was once or twice chartered by the Government on Northern Territory service. His love of progress always seemed to lead him towards steam, and because of a clear, far-seeing disposition he soon saw the opening for steamers to enter on the Spencer's Gulf trade. In association with Captain Ward, Captain McCoy soon put the Marion and Lubra in commission, Captain McCoy having the former lost by some mischance, she was wrecked in the bay near the Althorps which bears the name of the ill-fated steamer. Then he remained on shore and took an active part in the Spencer's Gulf trade, and employed many steamers, such as the Kangaroo the Coorong and others. Abuut twenty years ago he was mainly instrumental in getting from home the Victorian and South Australian, boats equal to the trade of the day.
<br><br>
Meantime the spirit of rivalry had broken down freights and passage-money to the lowest possible ebb, and it was soon seen by the captain what good results would ensue from amalgamation. This was of Captain McCoy's master strokes, for unostentaiously, he was the principal one to carry out the arrangements whuh led to the formation of the present Adelaide Steamship Company. He was on the Commission of the Peace for many years. In private he was a most estimated man of rare principle and acquirements, and to those privileged to enjoy his friendship he was as a book containing much valuable knowledge which was as the service of those who sought it. 
<br><br>
His mind was full of the incidents of his early life and voyages, the relation of which would fill a book, and his knowledge of the rise and progress of our shipping was unique. There have been few men in our midst whose whole life was so consistently passed in tbe study of matters maritime, and fewer who had a record for general success. There is the prospect of the Adelaide Steamship Company remaining in a prosperous condition, which was in a great measure brought about by Captain McCoy. It has been this writer's pleasure to go on side by side in shipping matters with tho late Captain for nearly half a century, during which time the latter was always a philosopher and friend to refer to in knotty technical maritime matters, in tho solution of which he was seldom wrong.
