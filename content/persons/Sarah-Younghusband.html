Sarah was daughter of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Younghusband">William Younghusband</a>, a politician in the colony of South Australia, <a href="https://www.parliament.sa.gov.au/Search/Member?type=member&id=4156">Member</a> of the South Australian Legislative Council. Younghusband Peninsula and the town of Younghusband on the River Murray are named after him. 
<br><br>
William was second owner to <a href = "https://gawlerhistory.com/index.php?title=Gawler_Farm&mobileaction=toggle_view_desktop"> <b>Gawler Farm</b></a> and from this document we can discover how the property changed hands to members of the Sanderson family.
<br><br><br>
On 20th February 1840, Sections 16 & 17 were purchased by James Ilbery. The property was named Gawler Farm and the Ilberys constructed a home there. In 1842, James Ilbery was jailed for cattle theft and ownership passed through his wife Henrietta to her sister, Louisa's husband William Younghusband who lived in Fleetwood in England.
<br><br>
Henrietta continued to live there and James Ilbery was indebted to Chariot Sophia Thomas £1726. (Chariot was the mother of Henrietta and Louisa). William Younghusband came to South Australia with his wife Louisa and took up residence with Henrietta. About this time the property became known as Floraville.
<br><br>
In 1851, William Younghusband purchased Section 3045 for £132.1.0. In 1853, Henrietta Evelin Ilbury died in Calcutta India.
In 1853 Section 16 & 17 reverted to, and became vested in William.
<br><br>
On July 1st, 1856, Sarah Younghusband, aged 19, eldest daughter of William Younghusband, married Frederick James Sanderson.
<br><br>
On the 5th May 1863, Younghusband died in Rome and the property was willed to daughters (ed. grand-daugthers) Louisa Marshall and <a href = "persons\Edith-Ferguson-Sanderson.html">Edith Ferguson Mayne</a>. In 1864, Floraville was destroyed by fire and in 1891 was the final distribution of Younghusbands Estate.
<br><br>
On 1st October 1918, was conveyance of Section 17 to <a href="Francis-Villiers-Sanderson.html">Francis Villiers Sanderson</a> from <a href = "persons\Edith-Ferguson-Sanderson.html">Edith Ferguson Mayne</a> (ed. his sister). On 18th June 1934, the property was freehold to Francis Villiers Sanderson (grandson of William Younghusband and son of Frederick James Sanderson and Sarah Younghusband). In 1938 was the death of F.V. Sanderson.
<br><br>
At this point in the document, names and relationships are unclear. More information may be found on on <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/tree/pedigree/MC2Q-PJP">FamilySearch</a>.
<br><br>
1947 - property transferred to Sanderson, Lucas, and Davenport as tenants in common (daughters of Sanderson)
<br>
1951 - Marjorie, Valerie, and Evelyn Lucas and Villiers Davenport as absentee owners.
<br>
1970 - Sanderson Estate purchased by Philips family.
